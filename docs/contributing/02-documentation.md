# Documentation

We'd love help with documentation!

## Asciinema recordings

Record them down using [`asciinema`](https://asciinema.org)!

## Missing docs

Did you find something not documented in the docs that should be?
Raise the issue in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ericmjl/pyds-cli/issues),
