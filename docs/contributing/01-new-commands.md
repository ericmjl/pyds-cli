# Contributing new commands to the public package

PyDS is intentionally targeting the broadest possible audience.
Therefore, idiosyncratic workflows are intentionally out-of-scope.
The issue tracker is the place to propose new workflows.
There should be at least 50 thumbs up on the proposed new command
and its underlying shell implementation.

New workflows should satisfy the [design philosophy](design/) of the package.
They should also be well-established workflows,
with arguments presented why they are well-established.
(Evidence may include a smattering of blog posts introducing "how to do X",
official documentation present on the tool,
and )
