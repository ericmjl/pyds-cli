Hence, workflows commonly associated with software development,
such as writing tests and documentation,
_ought_ to be part of a data scientist's workflow as well.

## Testing with `pytest`

`pytest` is the modern way to handle software testing.

## Docs with `mkdocs`

MkDocs is a growing and popular alternative to Sphinx,
which has historically been the backbone of Python project documentation.

it's a robot. ðŸ˜…
CI/CD systems, such as GitHub Actions,
are robots that you can program using YAML
(or, gasp! Jenkins) files
rather than Bash scripts alone.
