## Version 0.3.8

This new version includes several updates to the testing environment, pre-commit hooks, and GitHub Actions workflow. It also introduces a change to the setuptools configuration in the pyproject.toml.j2 template.

### New Features

- The pytest fixture scope in the cli tests has been changed from "session" to "function", ensuring a more isolated testing environment (23ad0d0) (Eric Ma)
- The versions of pre-commit hooks have been updated to their latest versions, and the darglint hook has been replaced with pydoclint for better documentation linting (23ad0d0) (Eric Ma)
- The pytest fixture scope in the conftest.py file has been changed from "function" to "session", potentially improving the performance of the test suite (23ad0d0) (Eric Ma)
- The conda tests for rebuild and update now expect an exit code of 1 instead of 0, reflecting the assumption that these tests are always executed from within a conda environment, not the base environment (23ad0d0) (Eric Ma)
- The trigger events for the GitHub Actions workflow have been modified to include both pull requests and pushes to the main branch, and the version of the checkout action has been updated from v2 to v4 (52b7520) (Eric Ma)
- The setuptools configuration in the pyproject.toml.j2 template has been updated. The 'packages' field under 'tool.setuptools' has been replaced with a 'where' field under 'tool.setuptools.packages.find', allowing for more flexible package discovery (4fc10ff) (Eric Ma)
