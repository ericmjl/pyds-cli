## Version 0.4.2

This release includes several improvements to the presentation template, build process, and GitHub Actions workflow.

### New Features

- Updated presentation options in the talk template, changing the transition effect to 'slide' and adding a 'nord' highlight theme for code blocks (6e6fe7f, Eric Ma)
- Added a markdownlint configuration file to enforce style and conventions within talk templates (65fad6d, Eric Ma)

### Bug Fixes

- Corrected the syntax for accessing `GHPAGES_TOKEN` secret in the GitHub Actions workflow for publishing (1adeed5, Eric Ma)
- Streamlined the slide build and deployment process by replacing direct reveal-md commands with `make build` in GitHub Actions and simplifying the `Makefile` (78fbf50, Eric Ma)
- Fixed a missing newline at the end of the v0.4.1 release notes document for better compatibility with UNIX text processing tools and standards (538c395, Eric Ma)
