## Version 0.6.4

This release includes several updates to the CLI configuration and test setup, as well as a version bump.

### New Features

- The global git configuration has been moved from the test script to the CI workflow, and direct git command dependencies have been removed from the test scripts. This should improve the reliability and maintainability of the test setup. (b22f168) (Eric Ma)
- The CLI configuration has been updated to use GitHub Tester credentials by default. This should make it easier to use the CLI with GitHub testing. (1564e65) (Eric Ma)

### Bug Fixes

- The version of the `pyds-cli` package in the `pixi.lock` file has been updated to 0.6.3 for compatibility. The SHA256 hash for the new version has also been updated. (f7bce31) (Eric Ma)
- The installation instructions in the `README.md` file have been updated to use the `pixi install` command. (7b59f66) (Eric Ma)
