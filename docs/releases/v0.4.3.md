- Fixed an issue with the `__project_snakecase` variable in `cookiecutter.json` to handle hyphens correctly (08beffb) (Eric Ma)

### Deprecations

Additionally, various hook versions have been updated to their latest versions to ensure compatibility and leverage improvements:

- Pre-commit hooks: v4.6.0

Please note that the version of pydoclint has been updated to v0.3.8 in the pre-commit configuration. (23a38b3) (Eric Ma)

Finally, the pre-commit hooks are now properly installed in the CI environment before running, preventing potential issues related to missing or misconfigured hooks. (3552315) (Eric Ma)
