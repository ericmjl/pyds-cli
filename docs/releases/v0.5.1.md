## Version 0.5.1

This release includes improvements to the project initialization process, with the addition of a .env file creation feature. This enhancement helps manage environment variables and paths for new Python data science projects.

### New Features

- A .env file is now automatically generated during project initialization, which is crucial for managing environment variables and paths that should not be exposed publicly. (a3613e2, Eric Ma)
- A test case has been added to verify the presence of a .env file in the initialized project directory, ensuring that projects are correctly setting up environment variables. (f56e7b2, Eric Ma)
