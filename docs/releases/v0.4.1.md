Note: The commit `f97ab3ff2dedd91b5747614c7babe8984596e536` by `github-actions` only bumped the version number, so it is not included in the release notes. The commit `851a62b8773499b68a5cdb65942138b9d9a4dd84` by `github-actions` added the release notes for version 0.4.0, so it is also not included in the release notes for version 0.4.1.
